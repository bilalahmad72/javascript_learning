The whole browser that we see that is  " window object "

A Window object ( web page ) depend on three things its mean the window can be access by three things => 

1) Javascript 2) BOM  3) DOM

Javascript =>  Objects, Array, Functions, Classes

DOM => Document Object Model, its consist on all of the elements ( buttons, tags ) that we seen on the webpage. 

Body tag and also all other tags come inside the DOM, 


BOM => Browser Object Model, its consist on screen (everything about the screen like heigt, width, size etc, navigator, and location like at which webpage user is right now ).


TO access the whole web page we use the document keyword.

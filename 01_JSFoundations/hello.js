// in now a days semi colon at the end of line is optional for JAVASCRIPT
console.log("Hello World");

// to run the file we use => node filename with extension
// as right now file name is ( hello.js ), so we run node hello.js
// after run the command will see the output of the file

// shortcut command for console.log is log on VS Code

// It is necessary to save the file before run command => ( node hello.js)

console.log("Hello World!");

console.log("Pakistan Zindabad!");

console.log("How are you!");

console.log("This is Javascript!");
console.log("loading...");

// the see the structure how javascript code is run? which compiler is used? what compiler do?  see the images ( first.png & second.png)

// JIT compiler is used ( Just in Time )

// There are some other software exists that can run the javascript or used for runtime of javascript ( node, bun, JavaScript Core, Deno etc )...

// search these software on the google to learn about these

// but mostly node is used, so that's why node will be used
